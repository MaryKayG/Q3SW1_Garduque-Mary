        <center><h6 class="analysis">A coming-of-age romantic comedy that revolves around Choi Ung (Choi Woo-shik) and Kook Yeon-soo (Kim Da-mi), ex-lovers who broke up with a promise to never meet again. As luck would have it, the documentary they filmed ten years ago in high school went viral and they are forced to face the cameras together again by their producer friend. The series depicts their complicated feelings and growth. This drama shows what love feels like. Instead of discussing practical issues like family conflicts, it tells a story about throb, memory and dream. Romance is revealed in many small, unnoticed acts.</h6></center>
